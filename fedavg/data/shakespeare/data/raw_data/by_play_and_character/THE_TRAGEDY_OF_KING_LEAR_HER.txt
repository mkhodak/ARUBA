(reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists of
 the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,
 that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound
 of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'
Again!                                    Second trumpet.
Again!                                     Third trumpet.
                                     Trumpet answers within.
Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.
What are you?
 Your name, your quality? and why you answer
 This present summons?
