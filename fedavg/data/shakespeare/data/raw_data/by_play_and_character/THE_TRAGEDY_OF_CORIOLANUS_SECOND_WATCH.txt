Stand, and go back.
You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot
pass. Therefore go back.
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the
way home again.
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
The worthy fellow is our general; he's the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.                            Exeunt
