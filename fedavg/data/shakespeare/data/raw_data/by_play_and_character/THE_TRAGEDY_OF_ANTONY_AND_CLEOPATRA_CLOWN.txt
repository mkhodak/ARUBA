Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
do die of it do seldom or never recover.
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no
longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given
to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how
she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes
a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that
they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is
most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
I wish you all joy of the worm.

You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his
kind.
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
the feeding.
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for
the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same
whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
every ten that they make the devils mar five.
Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th' worm.         Exit
         Re-enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c.
