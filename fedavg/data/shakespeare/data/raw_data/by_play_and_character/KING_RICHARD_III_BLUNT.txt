He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
Unless I have mista'en his colours much-
Which well I am assur'd I have not done-
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the King.
Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
