Why will my lord do so?
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
And so should you.
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
And we are women's men.
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
Well I know the man.
                    Enter a MESSENGER
With news the time's with labour and throes forth
Each minute some.                                     Exeunt
                      SCENE VIII.
                  A plain near Actium
         Enter CAESAR, with his army, marching
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
O, he has given example for our flight
Most grossly by his own!
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse; six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.
