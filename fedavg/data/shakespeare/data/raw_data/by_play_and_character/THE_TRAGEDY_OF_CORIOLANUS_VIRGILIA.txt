But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.
His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
I am glad to see your ladyship.
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
A crack, madam.
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
prayers; but I cannot go thither.
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
Indeed, madam?
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
hereafter.
No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much
mirth.
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
O, no, no, no.
The gods grant them true!
O heavens! O heavens!
O the gods!
 [To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too. I would I had the
  power
To say so to my husband.
What then!
He'd make an end of thy posterity.
My lord and husband!
The sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd
Makes you think so.
Ay, and mine,
That brought you forth this boy to keep your name
Living to time.
