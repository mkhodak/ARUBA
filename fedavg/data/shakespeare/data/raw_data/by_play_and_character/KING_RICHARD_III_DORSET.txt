No man but prophesied revenge for it.
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be inviolable.
Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
