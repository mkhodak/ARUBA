At hand, quoth pickpurse.
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told
you yesternight. There's a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath
brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it
to one of his company last night at supper- a kind of auditor;
one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are
up already and call for eggs and butter. They will away
presently.
No, I'll none of it. I pray thee keep that for the hangman;
for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of
falsehood may.
What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water
in foul way?
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night
than to fernseed for your walking invisible.
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
