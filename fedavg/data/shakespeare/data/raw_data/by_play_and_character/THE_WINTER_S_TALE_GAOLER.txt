For a worthy lady,
And one who much I honour.
I may not, madam;
To the contrary I have express commandment.
So please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants,
Shall bring Emilia forth.
And, madam,
I must be present at your conference.
Madam, if't please the Queen to send the babe,
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warrant.
I do believe it.
