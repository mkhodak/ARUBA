What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
 Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
                      partisans.
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain, that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
It fits when such a villain is a guest.
I'll not endure him.
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
occasion.
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this: thou art a villain.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
What wouldst thou have with me?
I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
