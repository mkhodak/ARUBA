Lord Timon, hear me speak.
Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
By night frequents my house. I am a man
That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift,
And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
Than one which holds a trencher.
One only daughter have I, no kin else,
On whom I may confer what I have got.
The maid is fair, o' th' youngest for a bride,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love; I prithee, noble lord,
Join with me to forbid him her resort;
Myself have spoke in vain.
Therefore he will be, Timon.
His honesty rewards him in itself;
It must not bear my daughter.
She is young and apt:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levity's in youth.
If in her marriage my consent be missing,
I call the gods to witness I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
And dispossess her all.
Three talents on the present; in future, all.
Most noble lord,
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
