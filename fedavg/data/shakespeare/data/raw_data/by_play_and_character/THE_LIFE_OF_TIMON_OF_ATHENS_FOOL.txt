How do you, gentlemen?
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you
are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
Will you leave me there?
Are you three usurers' men?
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant. My mistress
is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your
masters, they approach sadly and go away merry; but they enter my
mistress' house merrily and go away sadly. The reason of this?
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a
spirit. Sometime 't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer;
sometime like a philosopher, with two stones moe than's
artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and, generally,
in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to
thirteen, this spirit walks in.
Nor thou altogether a wise man.
As much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lack'st.
I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman;
sometime the philosopher.
