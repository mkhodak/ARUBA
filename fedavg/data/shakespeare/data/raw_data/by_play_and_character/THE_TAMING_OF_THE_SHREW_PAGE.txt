How fares my noble lord?
Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two;
Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
In peril to incur your former malady,
That I should yet absent me from your bed.
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
It is a kind of history.
My lord, 'tis but begun.
