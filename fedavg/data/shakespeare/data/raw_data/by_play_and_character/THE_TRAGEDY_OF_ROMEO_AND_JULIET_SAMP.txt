Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
I strike quickly, being moved.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the
wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are
ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought
with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
their heads.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
am a pretty piece of flesh.
My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
Fear me not.
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
[aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
thumb, sir.
But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
Well, sir.
                    Enter Benvolio.
Yes, better, sir.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
                                                 They fight.
