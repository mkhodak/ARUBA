There is means, madam.
 Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
 The which he lacks. That to provoke in him
 Are many simples operative, whose power
 Will close the eye of anguish.
Madam, sleeps still.
So please your Majesty
 That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
 I doubt not of his temperance.
Please you draw near. Louder the music there!
Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
Be comforted, good madam. The great rage
 You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger
 To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
 Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more
 Till further settling.
