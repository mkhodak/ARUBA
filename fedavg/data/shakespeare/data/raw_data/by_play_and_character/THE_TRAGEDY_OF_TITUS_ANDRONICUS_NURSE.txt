Good morrow, lords.
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
Our Empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace!
She is delivered, lord; she is delivered.
I mean she is brought a-bed.
A devil.
A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime;
The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
Cornelia the midwife and myself;
And no one else but the delivered Empress.
