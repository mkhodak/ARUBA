     Philomel with melody
           Sing in our sweet lullaby.
           Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby.
           Never harm
           Nor spell nor charm
           Come our lovely lady nigh.
           So good night, with lullaby.
     Philomel with melody, etc.       [TITANIA Sleeps]
