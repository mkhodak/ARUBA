I know you well enough. You are Signior Antonio.
I know you by the waggling of your head.
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very
man. Here's his dry hand up and down. You are he, you are he!
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent
wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum you are he. Graces will
appear, and there's an end.              [ They step aside.]
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full, as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
Sure I think so;
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love, lest she'll make sport at it.
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!
She cannot be so much without true judgment
(Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is priz'd to have) as to refuse
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
I pray you be not angry with me, madam,
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
For shape, for bearing, argument, and valour,
Goes foremost in report through Italy.
His excellence did earn it ere he had it.
When are you married, madam?
She's lim'd, I warrant you! We have caught her, madam.
I will, lady.
Well.                                             [Exit.]
Madam, withdraw. The Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don
John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to
church.
Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old coil at home.
It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accus'd, the Prince
and Claudio mightily abus'd, and Don John is the author of all,
who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?
