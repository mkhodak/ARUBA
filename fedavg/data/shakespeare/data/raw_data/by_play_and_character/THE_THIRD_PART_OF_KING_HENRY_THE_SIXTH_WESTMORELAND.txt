What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
