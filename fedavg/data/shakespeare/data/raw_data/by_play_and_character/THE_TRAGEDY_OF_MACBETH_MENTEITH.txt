The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.
What does the tyrant?
Who then shall blame
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?
We doubt it nothing.
The Wood of Birnam.
