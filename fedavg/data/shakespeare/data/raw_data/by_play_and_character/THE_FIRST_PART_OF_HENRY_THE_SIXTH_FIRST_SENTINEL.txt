Sergeant, you shall.           [Exit SERGEANT]
Thus are poor servitors,
When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.
         Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and forces,
      with scaling-ladders; their drums beating a dead
                          march
