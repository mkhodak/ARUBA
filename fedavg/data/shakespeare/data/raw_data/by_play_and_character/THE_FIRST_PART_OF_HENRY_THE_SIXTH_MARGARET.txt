Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
The King of Naples-whosoe'er thou art.
Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so,
What ransom must I pay before I pass?
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
Why speak'st thou not? What ransom must I
pay?
Wilt thou accept of ransom-yea or no?
I were best leave him, for he will not hear.
He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
And yet I would that you would answer me.
He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.
Hear ye, Captain-are you not at leisure?
 [Aside]  What though I be enthrall'd? He seems
a knight,
And will not any way dishonour me.
 [Aside]  Perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French;
And then I need not crave his courtesy.
 [Aside]  Tush! women have been captivate ere
now.
I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.
To be a queen in bondage is more vile
Than is a slave in base servility;
For princes should be free.
Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
What?
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
An if my father please, I am content.
Farewell, my lord. Good wishes, praise, and
prayers,
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.          [She is going]
Such commendations as becomes a maid,
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,
Never yet taint with love, I send the King.
That for thyself, I will not so presume
To send such peevish tokens to a king.
                                Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
