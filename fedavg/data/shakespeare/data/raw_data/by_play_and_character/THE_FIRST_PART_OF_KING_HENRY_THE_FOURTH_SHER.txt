First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Hath followed certain men unto this house.
One of them is well known, my gracious lord-
A gross fat man.
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
Good night, my noble lord.
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
                                        Exit [with Carrier].
