James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
Prove me, my gracious lord.
Please you;
But I had rather kill two enemies.
Let me have open means to come to them,
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
I will dispatch it straight.                      Exit
                Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late request that you did sound me in.
The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
The most arch deed of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
Within their alabaster innocent arms.
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;
But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd;
When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bear this tidings to the bloody King.
                    Enter KING RICHARD
And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done.
I did, my lord.
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
I humbly take my leave.                           Exit
