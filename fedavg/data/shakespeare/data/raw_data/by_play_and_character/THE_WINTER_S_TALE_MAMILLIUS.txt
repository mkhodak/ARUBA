Ay, my good lord.
Yes, if you will, my lord.
No, my lord, I'll fight.
I am like you, they say.
No, I'll none of you.
You'll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best; so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
I learn'd it out of women's faces. Pray now,
What colour are your eyebrows?
Nay, that's a mock. I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
Merry or sad shall't be?
A sad tale's best for winter. I have one
Of sprites and goblins.
There was a man-
Dwelt by a churchyard- I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.
