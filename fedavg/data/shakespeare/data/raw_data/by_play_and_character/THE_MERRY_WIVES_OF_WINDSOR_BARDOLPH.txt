You Banbury cheese!
Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had
drunk himself out of his five sentences.
And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd;
and so conclusions pass'd the careers.
It is a life that I have desir'd; I will thrive.
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would
fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
sent your worship a moming's draught of sack.
Ay, sir.
Here, sir.
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you
Come in, woman.
                 Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
With eggs, sir?
Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses; the Duke himself will be to-morrow at court, and
they are going to meet him.
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!
Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I
came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like
three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
