Hail, heaven!
Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg'd,
Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age. But unto us it is
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit.
Uncertain favour!
I am thoroughly weary.
There is cold meat i' th' cave; we'll browse on that
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
What's the matter, sir?
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
No elder than a boy!
                   Re-enter IMOGEN
Money, youth?
Were you a woman, youth,
I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty
I bid for you as I'd buy.
Would I could free't!
Pray draw near.
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
I love thee; I have spoke it.
How much the quantity, the weight as much
As I do love my father.
I could not stir him.
He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters,
And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick,
And he her dieter.
I do note
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
Mingle their spurs together.
He is but one; you and my brother search
What companies are near. Pray you away;
Let me alone with him.         Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
A thing
More slavish did I ne'er than answering
'A slave' without a knock.
To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;
Why I should yield to thee.
No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,
Which, as it seems, make thee.
Hence, then, and thank
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
I am loath to beat thee.
What's thy name?
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
I cannot tremble at it. Were it toad, or adder, spider,
'Twould move me sooner.
I'm sorry for't; not seeming
So worthy as thy birth.
Those that I reverence, those I fear- the wise:
At fools I laugh, not fear them.
This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
There was no money in't. Not Hercules
Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none;
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
My head as I do his.
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
Son to the Queen, after his own report;
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
With his own single hand he'd take us in,
Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow,
And set them on Lud's Town.
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
Protects not us; then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
Play judge and executioner all himself,
For we do fear the law? What company
Discover you abroad?
With his own sword,
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
His head from him. I'll throw't into the creek
Behind our rock, and let it to the sea
And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.
That's all I reck.                                      Exit
Where's my brother?
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
In embassy to his mother; his body's hostage
For his return.                               [Solemn music]
Is he at home?
What does he mean? Since death of my dear'st mother
It did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?
   Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN as dead, bearing
                     her in his arms
O sweetest, fairest lily!
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when thou grew'st thyself.
Where?
Why, he but sleeps.
If he be gone he'll make his grave a bed;
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
And worms will not come to thee.
Prithee have done,
And do not play in wench-like words with that
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
And not protract with admiration what
Is now due debt. To th' grave.
By good Euriphile, our mother.
Cadwal,
I cannot sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee;
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie.
Pray you fetch him hither.
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
When neither are alive.
Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East;
My father hath a reason for't.
Come on, then, and remove him.
Fear no more the heat o' th' sun
           Nor the furious winter's rages;
         Thou thy worldly task hast done,
           Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.
         Golden lads and girls all must,
         As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
Fear no more the lightning flash,
Fear not slander, censure rash;
No exorciser harm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.
The noise is round about us.
Nay, what hope
Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use, and slay us after.
This is, sir, a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you
Nor satisfying us.
Than be so,
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army.
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
Cannot be questioned.
By heavens, I'll go!
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
I'll take the better care; but if you will not,
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans!
The same dead thing alive.
But we saw him dead.
This is sure Fidele.
Let me end the story:
I slew him there.
I have spoke it, and I did it.
A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea,
If it could so roar to me. I cut off's head,
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.
And our good his.
And at first meeting lov'd,
Continu'd so until we thought he died.
