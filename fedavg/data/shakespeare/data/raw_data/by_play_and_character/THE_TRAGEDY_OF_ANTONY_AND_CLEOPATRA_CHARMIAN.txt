Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
charge his horns with garlands!
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
Good, sir, give me good fortune.
Pray, then, foresee me one.
He means in flesh.
Wrinkles forbid!
Hush!
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
Then belike my children shall have no names.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
where would you choose it?
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
Isis, I beseech thee!
Amen.
Not he; the Queen.
No, madam.
I did not see him since.
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.
In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
In time we hate that which we often fear.
                        Enter ANTONY
But here comes Antony.
Madam?
Why, madam?
You think of him too much.
Madam, I trust, not so.
O that brave Caesar!
The valiant Caesar!
By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
The man is innocent.
He is afear'd to come.
Good your Highness, patience.
Many times, madam.
Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.
Excellent.
A proper man.
Nothing, madam.
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!
I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt
                      SCENE IV.
              Athens. ANTONY'S house
             Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA
Do? Why, what else?
Madam!
Please you retire to your chamber?
To th'monument!
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.
Be comforted, dear madam.
O, quietness, lady!
Lady!
O madam, madam, madam!
Peace, peace, Iras!
O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!
Madam, I will.
                  Re-enter DOLABELLA
Behold, sir.                                    Exit
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
The gods themselves do weep.
O Eastern star!
O, break! O, break!
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it and then play-
              Enter the guard, rushing in
Speak softly, wake her not.
Too slow a messenger.               [Applies an asp]
O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.
It is well done, and fitting for a princes
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]
                  Re-enter DOLABELLA
