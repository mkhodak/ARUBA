Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
              Enter CLIFFORD and soldiers
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws;
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
And not with such a cruel threat'ning look!
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath;
Be thou reveng'd on men, and let me live.
Then let my father's blood open it again:
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray: sweet Clifford, pity me.
I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
But 'twas ere I was born.
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
And when I give occasion of offence
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
