So that, from point to point, now have you hear
The fundamental reasons of this war;
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.
Be it his pleasure.
Welcome shall they be
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell.
To-morrow to th' field. Flourish.                     Exeunt
The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.
Then go thou forth;
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
As thy auspicious mistress!
