We are, my lord, and come to have the
warrant,
That we may be admitted where he is.
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
prate;
Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt
Ho! who's here?
I would speak with Clarence, and I came
hither on my legs.
You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
he wakes.
Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
sleeping.
What, art thou afraid?
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
tell him so.
How dost thou feel thyself now?
SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
are yet within me.
Remember our reward, when the deed's
done.
Where's thy conscience now?
When he opens his purse to give us our
reward, thy conscience flies out.
What if it come to thee again?
Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
persuading me not to kill the Duke.
I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
me.
Take him on the costard with the hilts of
thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
next room.
Soft! he wakes.
No, we'll reason with him.
A man, as you are.
My voice is now the King's, my looks
mine own.
Offended us you have not, but the King.
What we will do, we do upon command.
And like a traitor to the name of God
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
to us,
When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
Who made thee then a bloody minister
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
faults,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
Ay, so we will.
Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
deceive yourself:
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
That he would labour my delivery.
Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
 [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
this will not do,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
                                          Exit with the body
So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
And when I have my meed, I will away;
For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit
