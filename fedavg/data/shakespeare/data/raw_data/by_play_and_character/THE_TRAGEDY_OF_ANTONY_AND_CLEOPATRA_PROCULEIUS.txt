Caesar, I shall.                              Exit
Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
My name is Proculeius.
Be of good cheer;
Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
Make your full reference freely to my lord,
Who is so full of grace that it flows over
On all that need. Let me report to him
Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
This I'll report, dear lady.
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
Of him that caus'd it.
Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
Reliev'd, but not betray'd.
Cleopatra,
Do not abuse my master's bounty by
Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
His nobleness well acted, which your death
Will never let come forth.
O, temperance, lady!
You do extend
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar.
                  Enter DOLABELLA
So, Dolabella,
It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
[To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
If you'll employ me to him.
