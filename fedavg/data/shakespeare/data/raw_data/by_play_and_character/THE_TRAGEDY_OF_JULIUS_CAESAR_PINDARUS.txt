I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
[Above.] O my lord!
[Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
He's ta'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy.
So, I am free, yet would not so have been,
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.
            Re-enter Titinius with Messala.
