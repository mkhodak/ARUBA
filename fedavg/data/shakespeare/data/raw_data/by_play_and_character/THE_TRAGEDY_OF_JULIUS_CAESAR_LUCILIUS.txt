Give the word, ho, and stand.
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.
With courtesy and with respect enough,
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath used of old.
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.                     Low march within.
[Within.] You shall not come to them.
[Stands forth.] My lord?
                         Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,
And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.
Only I yield to die.
[Offers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:
Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
