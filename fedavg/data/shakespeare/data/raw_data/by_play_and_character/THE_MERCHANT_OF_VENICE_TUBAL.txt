I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in
Genoa-
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,
fourscore ducats.
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to
Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter
for a monkey.
But Antonio is certainly undone.
