Will this gear ne'er be mended?
Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part,
I'll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake
out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating
of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too,
or you may chance to burn your lips.
Well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her
look, or any woman else.
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well,
go to- there were no more comparison between the women. But, for
my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it,
praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
I did. I  will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit; but-
I speak no more than truth.
Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is: if
she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the
mends in her own hands.
I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but
small thanks for my labour.
Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as
Helen. An she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a Friday
as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she were a
blackamoor; 'tis all one to me.
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay
behind her father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her
the next time I see her. For my part, I'll meddle nor make no
more i' th' matter.
Not I.
Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all
as I found it, and there an end.               Exit. Sound alarum
What's that? What's that?
Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?- Good
morrow, Alexander.-How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm'd
and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?
E'en so. Hector was stirring early.
Was he angry?
True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about
him today, I can tell them that. And there's Troilus will not
come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell
them that too.
Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man
if you see him?
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!
Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
Himself! no, he's not himself. Would 'a were himself!
Well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus,
well! I would my heart were in her body! No, Hector is not a
better man than Troilus.
He is elder.
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not have his wit this
year.
Nor his qualities.
Nor his beauty.
YOU have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th'
other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, I must
confess- not brown neither-
Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
She prais'd his complexion above Paris.
So he has.
I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day
into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or
four hairs on his chin-
Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
lift as much as his brother Hector.
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
Why, you know, 'tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes
him better than any man in all Phrygia.
Does he not?
Why, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves
Troilus-
Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an
addle egg.
I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
chin. Indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, I must needs
confess.
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh'd that
her eyes ran o'er.
And Cassandra laugh'd.
And Hector laugh'd.
Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus'
chin.
They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
answer.
Quoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
and one of them is white.'
That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and fifty
hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. That white hair is my father,
and all the rest are his sons.' 'Jupiter!' quoth she 'which of
these hairs is Paris my husband?' 'The forked one,' quoth he,
'pluck't out and give it him.' But there was such laughing! and
Helen so blush'd, and Paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so
laugh'd that it pass'd.
Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
man born in April.
Hark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up
here and see them as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do,
sweet niece Cressida.
Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
most bravely. I'll tell you them all by their names as they pass
by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
                   AENEAS passes
That's Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He's one of the
flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus; you shall see
anon.
                   ANTENOR passes
That's Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and
he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
Troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. When comes Troilus?
I'll show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see him nod
at me.
You shall see.
That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man, niece. O brave
Hector! Look how he looks. There's a countenance! Is't not a
brave man?
Is 'a not? It does a man's heart good. Look you what
hacks are on his helmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you
there. There's no jesting; there's laying on; take't off who
will, as they say. There be hacks.
Swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
it's all one. By God's lid, it does one's heart good. Yonder
comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
                   PARIS passes
Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? Why,
this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home to-day? He's not
hurt. Why, this will do Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could
see Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
                  HELENUS passes
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
Helenus! no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I marvel
where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the people cry 'Troilus'?
Helenus is a priest.
Where? yonder? That's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus. There's a
man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!
Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him,
niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more
hack'd than Hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! O
admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. Go thy way,
Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a
goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris
is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change, would give an
eye to boot.
Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
porridge after meat! I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus.
Ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone. Crows and daws,
crows and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than
Agamemnon and all Greece.
Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!
Well, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any
eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good
shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth,
liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
You are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you
lie.
Say one of your watches.
You are such another!
               Enter TROILUS' BOY
Where?
Good boy, tell him I come.                       Exit Boy
I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
I will be with you, niece, by and by.
Ay, a token from Troilus.
Friend, you-pray you, a word. Do you not follow the young
Lord Paris?
You depend upon him, I mean?
You depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise
him.
You know me, do you not?
Friend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.
I do desire it.
Grace! Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles.
What music is this?
Know you the musicians?
Who play they to?
At whose pleasure, friend?
Command, I mean, friend.
Friend, we understand not one another: I am to courtly,
and thou art too cunning. At whose request do these men play?
Who, my cousin, Cressida?
It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady
Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I
will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business
seethes.
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company!
Fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them- especially
to you, fair queen! Fair thoughts be your fair pillow.
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince,
here is good broken music.
Truly, lady, no.
Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you
vouchsafe me a word?
Well sweet queen, you are pleasant with me. But, marry,
thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed friend, your
brother Troilus-
Go to, sweet queen, go to-commends himself most
affectionately to you-
Sweet queen, sweet queen; that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not,
in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no. -And, my
lord, he desires you that, if the King call for him at supper,
you will make his excuse.
What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
What says my sweet queen?-My cousin will fall out with
you.
No, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer
is sick.
Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?
No, your poor disposer's sick.
You spy! What do you spy?-Come, give me an instrument.
Now, sweet queen.
My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet
queen.
He! No, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
Come, come. I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing you a
song now.
Ay, you may, you may.
Love! Ay, that it shall, i' faith.
In good troth, it begins so.                      [Sings]
Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
       For, oh, love's bow
       Shoots buck and doe;
       The shaft confounds
       Not that it wounds,
But tickles still the sore.
These lovers cry, O ho, they die!
   Yet that which seems the wound to kill
Doth turn O ho! to ha! ha! he!
   So dying love lives still.
O ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
O ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!-hey ho!
Is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,
and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers. Is love a generation of
vipers? Sweet lord, who's a-field today?
Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend
to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
Farewell, sweet queen.
I will, sweet queen.                Exit. Sound a retreat
How now! Where's thy master? At my cousin Cressida's?
O, here he comes. How now, how now!
Have you seen my cousin?
Walk here i' th' orchard, I'll bring her straight.
  Exit
She's making her ready, she'll come straight; you must be
witty now. She does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as
if she were fray'd with a sprite. I'll fetch her. It is the
prettiest villain; she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en
sparrow.                                                     Exit
Come, come, what need you blush? Shame's a baby.-Here she
is now; swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.-
What, are you gone again? You must be watch'd ere you be made
tame, must you? Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw
backward, we'll put you i' th' fills.-Why do you not speak to
her?-Come, draw this curtain and let's see your picture.
Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! An 'twere
dark, you'd close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress
How now, a kiss in fee-farm! Build there, carpenter; the air is
sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The
falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i' th' river. Go to, go
to.
Words pay no debts, give her deeds; but she'll bereave
you o' th' deeds too, if she call your activity in question.
What, billing again? Here's 'In witness whereof the parties
interchangeably.' Come in, come in; I'll go get a fire.
  Exit
What, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?
I thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you'll
give him me. Be true to my lord; if he flinch, chide me for it.
Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred, though
they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won;
they are burs, I can tell you; they'll stick where they are
thrown.
Pretty, i' faith.
Leave! An you take leave till to-morrow morning-
Go to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I'll be the
witness. Here I hold your hand; here my cousin's. If ever you
prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains to
bring you together, let all pitiful goers- between be call'd to
the world's end after my name-call them all Pandars; let all
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids, and all
brokers between Pandars. Say 'Amen.'
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber
and a bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters, press it to death. Away!
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,
Bed, chamber, pander, to provide this gear!                Exeunt
[Within] What's all the doors open here?
How now, how now! How go maidenheads?
Here, you maid! Where's my cousin Cressid?
To do what? to do what? Let her say what.
What have I brought you to do?
Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! a poor capocchia! hast not
slept to-night? Would he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? A
bugbear take him!
Who's there? What's the matter? Will you beat down the
door? How now? What's the matter?
                      Enter AENEAS
Who's there? My lord Aeneas? By my troth,
I knew you not. What news with you so early?
Here! What should he do here?
Is he here, say you? It's more than I know, I'll be
sworn. For my own part, I came in late. What should he do here?
Is't possible? No sooner got but lost? The devil take
Antenor! The young prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I
would they had broke's neck.
                 Re-enter CRESSIDA
Ah, ah!
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst ne'er been born!
I knew thou wouldst be his death! O, poor gentleman! A plague
upon Antenor!
Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art
chang'd for Antenor; thou must to thy father, and be gone from
Troilus. 'Twill be his death; 'twill be his bane; he cannot bear
it.
Thou must.
Do, do.
Be moderate, be moderate.
Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!
What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. 'O
heart,' as the goodly saying is,
      O heart, heavy heart,
   Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
where he answers again
   Because thou canst not ease thy smart
   By friendship nor by speaking.
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we
may live to have need of such a verse. We see it, we see it. How
now, lambs!
Ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart
will be blown up by th' root?                                Exit
Do you hear, my lord? Do you hear?
Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles
me, and the foolish fortune of this girl, and what one thing,
what another, that I shall leave you one o' th's days; and I have
a rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones that
unless a man were curs'd I cannot tell what to think on't. What
says she there?
But hear you, hear you!
A goodly medicine for my aching bones! world! world! thus
is the poor agent despis'd! traitors and bawds, how earnestly are
you set a work, and how ill requited! Why should our endeavour be
so lov'd, and the performance so loathed? What verse for it? What
instance for it? Let me see-
      Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing
      Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
      And being once subdu'd in armed trail,
      Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted
cloths. As many as be here of pander's hall,
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
Or, if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
Some two months hence my will shall here be made.
It should be now, but that my fear is this,
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss.
Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
And at that time bequeath you my diseases.                   Exit
