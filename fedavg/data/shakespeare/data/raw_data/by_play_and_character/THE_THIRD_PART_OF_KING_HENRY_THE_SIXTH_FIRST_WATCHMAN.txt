Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;
The King by this is set him down to sleep.
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Who goes there?
