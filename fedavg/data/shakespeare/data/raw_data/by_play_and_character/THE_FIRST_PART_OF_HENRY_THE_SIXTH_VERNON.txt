Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
Till you conclude that he upon whose side
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
Then, for the truth and plainness of the case,
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
And keep me on the side where still I am.
In your behalf still will I wear the same.
Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
Disgracing of these colours that I wear
In honour of my noble Lord of York
Dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st?
Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
Hark ye: not so. In witness, take ye that.
                                               [Strikes him]
Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;
And, after, meet you sooner than you would.           Exeunt
Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.
And that is my petition, noble lord;
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
Yet know, my lord, I was provok'd by him,
And he first took exceptions at this badge,
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
