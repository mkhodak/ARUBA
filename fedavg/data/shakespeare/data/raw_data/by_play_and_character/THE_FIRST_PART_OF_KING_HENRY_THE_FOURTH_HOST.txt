O Jesu, my lord the Prince!
Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door
would speak with you. He says he comes from your father.
An old man.
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
O, the Father, how he holds his countenance!
O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as
ever I see!
O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come
to search the house. Shall I let them in?
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I
keep thieves in my house? I have search'd, I have enquired, so
has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The
tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.
Who, I? No; I defy thee! God's light, I was never call'd so
in mine own house before!
No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir
John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to
beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.
You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and
by-drinkings, and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound.
He? Alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft,
that that ring was copper!
My lord, I pray you hear me.
Good my lord, hear me.
So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so;
and, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth'd
man as he is, and said he would cudgel you.
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
Say, what thing? what thing?
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it!
I am an honest man's wife, and, setting thy knight-hood aside,
thou art a knave to call me so.
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows
where to have me, thou knave, thou!
So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you ought
him a thousand pound.
Nay, my lord, he call'd you Jack and said he would cudgel
you.
