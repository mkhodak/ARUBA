 [Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad
I came this way so happily; the King
Shall understand it presently.                               Exit
I'll show your Grace the strangest sight-
I think your Highness saw this many a day.
There my lord:
The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury;
Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,
Pages, and footboys.
