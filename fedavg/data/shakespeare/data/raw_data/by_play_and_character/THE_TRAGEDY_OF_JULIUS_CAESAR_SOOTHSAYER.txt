Caesar!
Beware the ides of March.
Beware the ides of March.
At mine own house, good lady.
About the ninth hour, lady.
Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol.
That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place more void and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.               Exit.
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
