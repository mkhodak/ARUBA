Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators.
Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
That, methinks, is strange.
No, my lord.
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
Even so great men great losses should endure.
[Stands forth.] What says my general?
Believe not so.
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
Where did you leave him?
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
Is not that he?
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error, melancholy's child,
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
Into his ears. I may say "thrusting" it,
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight.
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
How died my master, Strato?
Octavius, then take him to follow thee
That did the latest service to my master.
