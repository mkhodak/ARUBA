Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her
rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her
closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it,
afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while
in a most fast sleep.
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to
confirm my speech.
            Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise, and, upon my
life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
Why, it stood by her. She has light by her
 continually; 'tis her command.
Ay, but their sense is shut.
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of
an hour.
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.
Heaven knows what she has known.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body.
Pray God it be, sir.
Directly.
Good night, good doctor.
                                                     Exeunt.
