I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I think,
is Adrian.
I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em.
Know you me yet?
The same, sir.
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people
against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make
it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment
of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes
for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature
for the violent breaking out.
Banish'd, sir.
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the
fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out
with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in
these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no
request of his country.
I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things
from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you
an army ready, say you?
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I
think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily
well met, and most glad of your company.
Well, let us go together.
