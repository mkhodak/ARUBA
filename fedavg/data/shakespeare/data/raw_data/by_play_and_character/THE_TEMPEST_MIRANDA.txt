If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,
Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces! O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.
O, woe the day!
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp'd,
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay; not yet.'
Certainly, sir, I can.
'Tis far off,
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four, or five, women once, that tended me?
But that I do not.
Sir, are not you my father?
O, the heavens!
What foul play had we that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' th' teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.
Sir, most heedfully.
O, good sir, I do!
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
O the heavens!
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Alack, for pity!
I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again; it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!
How came we ashore?
Would I might
But ever see that man!
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you,
  sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confin'd into this rock, who hadst
Deserv'd more than a prison.
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
I might call him
A thing divine; for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.
Alack, for mercy!
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first
That e'er I sigh'd for. Pity move my father
To be inclin'd my way!
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle, and not fearful.
Beseech you, father!
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech; this is unwonted
Which now came from him.
Alas, now; pray you,
Work not so hard; I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile.
Pray, set it down and rest you; when this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;
He's safe for these three hours.
If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while; pray give me that;
I'll carry it to the pile.
It would become me
As well as it does you; and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
And yours it is against.
You look wearily.
Miranda-O my father,
I have broke your hest to say so!
I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you;
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts
I therein do forget.
Do you love me?
I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give, and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, if you will marry me;
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
Whether you will or no.
My husband, then?
And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
Till half an hour hence.
Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
Sweet lord, you play me false.
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
And I would call it fair play.
O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world
That has such people in't!
