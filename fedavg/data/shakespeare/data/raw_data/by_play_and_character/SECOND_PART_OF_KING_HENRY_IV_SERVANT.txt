Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at
Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the
Lord John of Lancaster.
Sir John Falstaff!
Sir John!
You mistake me, sir.
I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your
soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you you in your
throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man.
Sir, my lord would speak with you.
