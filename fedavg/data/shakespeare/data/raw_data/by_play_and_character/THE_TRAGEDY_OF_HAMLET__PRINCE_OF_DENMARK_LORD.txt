My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
take longer time.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
Laertes before you fall to play.
