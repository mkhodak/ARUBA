One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess- she
The fairest I have yet beheld- desires access
To your high presence.
But few,
And those but mean.
Ay; the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
That e'er the sun shone bright on.
Pardon, madam.
The one I have almost forgot- your pardon;
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow.
Women will love her that she is a woman
More worth than any man; men, that she is
The rarest of all women.
