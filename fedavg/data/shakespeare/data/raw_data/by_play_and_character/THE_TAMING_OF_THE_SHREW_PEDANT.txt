God save you, sir!
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
Of Mantua.
My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence, and must here deliver them.
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
I know him not, but I have heard of him,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.
Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
Signior Baptista may remember me
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.
Soft, son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself;
And- for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him- to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need none so
long as I live.
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking
out at the window.
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
somebody in this city under my countenance.
                   Re-enter BIONDELLO
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above
Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine
only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
Swear if thou dar'st.
