Book of Riddles! Why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore
Michaelmas?
Well, sir.
Ay, for fault of a better.
Ay, forsooth.
No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a
little yellow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard.
Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as
any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a
warrener.
Yes, indeed, does he.
Ay, forsooth, to desire her to-
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master,
in the way of marriage.
 [Aside to QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to come
under one body's hand.
Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward; every
way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town way.
I will, Sir.                                      Exit
Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh.
No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over the
stile, this way.
Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
from Master Slender.
There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into
his chamber; I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down;
I come to speak with her, indeed.
Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
Brainford?
My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her,
seeing her go thorough the streets, to know, sir, whether one
Nym, sir, that beguil'd him of a chain, had the chain or no.
And what says she, I pray, sir?
beguil'd Master Slender of his chain cozen'd him of it.
I would I could have spoken with the woman
herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too,
from him.
I may not conceal them, sir.
What sir?
May I be bold to say so, sir?
