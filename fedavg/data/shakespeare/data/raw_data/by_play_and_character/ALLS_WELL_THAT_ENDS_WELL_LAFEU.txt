You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
abundance.
He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
A fistula, my lord.
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
grief the enemy to the living.
How understand we that?
He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love.
Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
 [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
Good faith, across!
But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
Of your infirmity?
O, will you eat
No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
And write to her a love-line.
Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,
If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one that in her sex, her years, profession,
Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
For that is her demand, and know her business?
That done, laugh well at me.
Nay, I'll fit you,
And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
Nay, come your ways.
Nay, come your ways;
This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,
That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit
They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear.
To be relinquish'd of the artists-
Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
That gave him out incurable-
Not to be help'd-
Uncertain life and sure death.
I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
 [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly
Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in

Very hand of heaven.

Generally thankful.

Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
coranto.
'Fore God, I think so.
I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
And writ as little beard.
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
life.
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but
if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known
thee already.
Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
Ay; is it not a language I speak?
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
cannot bring thee.
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
worth.
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
a scruple.
Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
age will give me leave.                                 Exit
Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
you; you have a new mistress.
Who? God?
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat
thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe
themselves upon thee.
Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.
                       Enter BERTRAM
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
You have it from his own deliverance.
Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
make us friends; I will pursue the amity
                     Enter PAROLLES
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
very good tailor.
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
God save you, Captain.
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
must do good against evil.                              Exit
No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow
there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd
and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law
had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak
of.
'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
sallets ere we light on such another herb.
They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
Your distinction?
So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
No, no, no.
Who's that? A Frenchman?
What prince is that?
Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest
thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee
so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell
you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to
speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to
stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there
is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
admitted.
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my
God, it holds yet.
                     Re-enter CLOWN
A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of
honour; so belike is that.
Let us go see your son, I pray you;
I long to talk with the young noble soldier.
And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her
nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that
she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would
not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for
you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for
other business.
You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your
word.
You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your
hand. How does your drum?
Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the
office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the
other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I
know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had
talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you
shall eat. Go to; follow.
This I must say-
But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord
Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,
Offence of mighty note; but to himself
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
Humbly call'd mistress.
All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
He looks well on 't.
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
Must be digested; give a favour from you,
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
That she may quickly come.
                                      [BERTRAM gives a ring]
By my old beard,
And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,
The last that e'er I took her leave at court,
I saw upon her finger.
I am sure I saw her wear it.
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.
I'll none of him.
 [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for
my daughter; you are no husband for her.
I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at
pleasure.
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [To PAROLLES]
Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I
thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee;
let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.
