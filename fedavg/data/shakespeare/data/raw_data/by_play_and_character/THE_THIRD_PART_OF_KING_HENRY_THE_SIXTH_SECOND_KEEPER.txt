I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
    Enter KING HENRY, disguised, with a prayer-book
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath depos'd;
And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
Here in this country, where we now remain.
