Do you call, sir?
A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit our mystery.
Ay, sir; a mystery.
Sir, it is a mystery.
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be too
little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it
be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough; so
every true man's apparel fits your thief.

Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
What ho, Barnardine!
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
Go in to him, and fetch him out.
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers;
for, look you, the warrant's come.
Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father.
Do we jest now, think you?
