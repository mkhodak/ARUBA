Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and
unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after
noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time
of the day, Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons,
and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping
houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in
flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so
superfluous to demand the time of the day.
What, none?
Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of
us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being
governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof now: a purse
of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by,'
and spent with crying 'Bring in'; now ill as low an ebb as the
foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge
of the gallows.
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle- and is not
a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and
where it would not, I have used my credit.
No; thou shalt.
Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the
hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
For obtaining of suits?
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor
Ditch?
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and
no man regards it.
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
I see a good amendment of life in thee- from praying to
purse-taking.
Good morrow, Ned.
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his
bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give
the devil his due.
Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil.
Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
I care not.
Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
                                              Exit Falstaff.
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by
our habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
Well, I'll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary
and meet me to-night in Eastcheap. There I'll sup. Farewell.
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
The unyok'd humour of your idleness.
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world,
That, when he please again to lie himself,
Being wanted, he may be more wond'red at
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
If all the year were playing holidays,
To sport would be as tedious as to work;
But when they seldom come, they wish'd-for come,
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
So, when this loose behaviour I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised,
By how much better than my word I am,
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
My reformation, glitt'ring o'er my fault,
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
I'll so offend to make offence a skill,
Redeeming time when men think least I will.            Exit.
Stand close.                        [They step aside.]
                         Enter Falstaff.
I comes forward I Peace, ye fat-kidney'd rascal! What a
brawling dost thou keep!
He is walk'd up to the top of the hill. I'll go seek him.
                                              [Steps aside.]
[comes forward] Peace, ye fat-guts! Lie down, lay thine ear
close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of
travellers.
Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
Out, ye rogue! Shall I be your ostler?
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned
Poins and I will walk lower. If they scape from your encounter,
then they light on us.
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
Well, we leave that to the proof.
[aside to Poins] Ned, where are our disguises?
The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou and I
rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it would be argument
for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.
Your money!
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse.
The thieves are scattered, and possess'd with fear
So strongly that they dare not meet each other.
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death
And lards the lean earth as he walks along.
Were't not for laughing, I should pity him.
Ned, prithee come out of that fat-room and lend me thy hand
to laugh a little.
Thou art perfect.
Come hither, Francis.
How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
Five year! by'r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of
Pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the
coward with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and
run from it?
How old art thou, Francis?
Nay, but hark you, Francis. For the sugar thou gavest me-
'twas a pennyworth, wast not?
I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask me when thou
wilt, and, thou shalt have it.
Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or,
Francis, a Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But
Francis-
Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button,
not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch-
Why then, your brown bastard is your only drink; for look
you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully. In Barbary,
sir, it cannot come to so much.
Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call?
          Here they both call him. The Drawer stands amazed,
                                not knowing which way to go.
                     Enter Vintner.
Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
                                              [Exit Vintner.]
Poins!
Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the
door. Shall we be merry?
I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours
since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this
present this twelve o'clock at midnight.
                     [Enter Francis.]
What's o'clock, Francis?
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet
of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the North; he that kills me some
six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and
says to his wife, 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my
sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many hast thou  kill'd to-day?'
'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he, and answers 'Some
fourteen,' an hour after, 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee call in
Falstaff. I'll play Percy, and that damn'd brawn shall play Dame
Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call
in tallow.
       Enter Falstaff, [Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto;
               Francis follows with wine].
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
Pitiful-hearted butter, that melted at the sweet tale of the sun!
If thou didst, then behold that compound.
How now, woolsack? What mutter you?
Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
O villain! thy lips are scarce wip'd since thou drunk'st
last.
What's the matter?
Where is it, Jack? Where is it?
What, a hundred, man?
Speak, sirs. How was it?
What, fought you with them all?
Pray God you have not murd'red some of them.
What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.
Seven? Why, there were but four even now.
[aside to Poins] Prithee let him alone. We shall have more
anon.
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
So, two more already.
O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two!
These lies are like their father that begets them- gross as
a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brain'd guts, thou
knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch-
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green when
it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your
reason. What sayest thou to this?
I'll be no longer guilty, of this sin; this sanguine
coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill
of flesh-
Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou
hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.
We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were
masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain tale shall put you
down. Then did we two set on you four and, with a word, outfac'd
you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here
in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as
nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roar'd for mercy, and still
run and roar'd, as ever I heard bullcalf. What a slave art thou
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in
fight! What trick, what device, what starting hole canst thou now
find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?
Content- and the argument shall be thy running away.
How now, my lady the hostess? What say'st thou to me?
Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him
back again to my mother.
Prithee do, Jack.
Now, sirs. By'r Lady, you fought fair; so did you, Peto; so
did you, Bardolph. You are lions too, you ran away upon instinct,
you will not touch the true prince; no- fie!
Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so
hack'd?
O villain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago
and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blush'd
extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou
ran'st away. What instinct hadst thou for it?
I do.
Hot livers and cold purses.
No, if rightly taken, halter.
                     Enter Falstaff.
Here comes lean Jack; here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet
creature of bombast? How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest
thine own knee?
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a
sparrow flying.
So did he never the sparrow.
Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for
running!
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
Why then, it is like, if there come a hot June, and this
civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy
hobnails, by the hundreds.
Not a whit, i' faith. I lack some of thy instinct.
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the
particulars of my life.
Thy state is taken for a join'd-stool, thy golden sceptre
for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful
bald crown.
Well, here is my leg.
What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll
play my father.
Well, here I am set.
Now, Harry, whence come you?
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er look on me.
Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil
haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man; a tun of man is
thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours,
that bolting hutch of beastliness, that swoll'n parcel of
dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuff'd cloakbag of
guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly,
that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that
vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink
it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it?
wherein cunning, but in craft? wherein crafty, but in villany?
wherein villanous, but in all things? wherein worthy, but in
nothing?
That villanous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,
that old white-bearded Satan.
I know thou dost.
I do, I will.                      [A knocking heard.]
                    [Exeunt Hostess, Francis, and Bardolph.]
                 Enter Bardolph, running.
Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick!
What's the matter?
And thou a natural coward without instinct.
Go hide thee behind the arras. The rest walk, up above.
Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.
Call in the sheriff.
                        [Exeunt Manent the Prince and Peto.]
                Enter Sheriff and the Carrier.
Now, Master Sheriff, what is your will with me?
What men?
The man, I do assure you, is not here,
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
That I will by to-morrow dinner time
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
For anything he shall be charg'd withal;
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
It may be so. If he have robb'd these men,
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
I think it is good morrow, is it not?
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go call him
forth.
Hark how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
        He searcheth his pockets and findeth certain papers.
What hast thou found?
Let's see whit they be. Read them.
O monstrous! but one halfpennyworth of bread to this
intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep close; we'll
read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I'll to
the court in the morning . We must all to the wars. and thy place
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of
foot; and I know, his death will be a march of twelve score. The
money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes
in the morning, and so good morrow, Peto.
So please your Majesty, I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal.
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As, in reproof of many tales devis'd,
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear
By, smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,
I may, for some things true wherein my youth
Hath faulty wand'red and irregular,
And pardon on lily true submission.
I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
Be more myself.
Do not think so. You shall not find it so.
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me!
I will redeem all this on Percy's head
And, in the closing of some glorious day,
Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
When I will wear a garment all of blood,
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it.
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
That this same child of honour and renown,
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.
For every honour sitting on his helm,
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled! For the time will come
That I shall make this Northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
And I will call hall to so strict account
That he shall render every glory up,
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
This in the name of God I promise here;
The which if he be pleas'd I shall perform,
I do beseech your Majesty may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.
If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
What say'st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband?
I love him well; he is an honest man.
What say'st thou, Jack?
What didst thou lose, Jack?
A trifle, some eightpenny matter.
What! he did not?
An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?
Thou say'st true, hostess, and he slanders thee most
grossly.
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
I say, 'tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
And why not as the lion?
O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees!
But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in
this bosom of thine. It is all fill'd up with guts and midriff.
Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou
whoreson, impudent, emboss'd rascal, if there were anything in
thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy houses,
and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long-winded-
if thy pocket were enrich'd with any other injuries but these, I
am a villain. And yet you will stand to it; you will not pocket
up wrong. Art thou not ashamed?
It appears so by the story.
O my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee.
The money is paid back again.
I am good friends with my father, and may do anything.
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
Bardolph!
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,
To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
                                            [Exit Bardolph.]
Go, Poins, to horse, to horse; for thou and I
Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
                                               [Exit Poins.]
Jack, meet me to-morrow in the Temple Hall
At two o'clock in the afternoon.
There shalt thou know thy charge. and there receive
Money and order for their furniture.
The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
And either they or we must lower lie.                [Exit.]
How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt?
I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already
made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that
come after?
I did never see such pitiful rascals.
No, I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on the
ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste. Percy 's already in the
field.
The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day.
Peace, chewet, peace!
In both our armies there is many a soul
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes,
This present enterprise set off his head,
I do not think a braver gentleman,
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
More daring or more bold, is now alive
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
I have a truant been to chivalry;
And so I hear he doth account me too.
Yet this before my father's Majesty-
I am content that he shall take the odds
Of his great name and estimation,
And will to save the blood on either side,
Try fortune with him in a single fight.
It will not be accepted, on my life.
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms.
Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship.
Say thy prayers, and farewell.
Why, thou owest God a death.
What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
Whose deaths are yet unreveng'd. I prithee
Rend me thy sword.
He is indeed, and living to kill thee.
I prithee lend me thy sword.
Give it me. What, is it in the case?
I do beseech your Majesty make up,
Lest Your retirement do amaze your friends.
Lead me, my lord, I do not need your help;
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
By God, thou hast deceiv'd me, Lancaster!
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.
Before, I lov'd thee as a brother, John;
But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
O, this boy
Lends mettle to us all!                                Exit.
                     Enter Douglas.
Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
Never to hold it up again! The spirits
Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms.
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
                                 They fight. Douglas flieth.
Cheerly, my lord. How fares your Grace?
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,
And so hath Clifton. I'll to Clifton straight.
O God! they did me too much injury
That ever said I heark'ned for your death.
If it were so, I might have let alone
The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
Which would have been as speedy in your end
As all the poisonous potions in the world,
And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son.
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
Why, then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name.
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
To share with me in glory any more.
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,
Nor can one England brook a double reign
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,
And all the budding honours on thy crest
I'll crop to make a garland for my head.
For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart!
Ill-weav'd ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
I should not make so dear a show of zeal.
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
But not rememb'red in thy epitaph!
                           He spieth Falstaff on the ground.
What, old acquaintance? Could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
I could have better spar'd a better man.
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee
If I were much in love with vanity!
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
Embowell'd will I see thee by-and-by;
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.                 Exit.
                 Falstaff riseth up.
Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
Thy maiden sword.
I did; I saw him dead,
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art thou alive,
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
I prithee speak. We will not trust our eyes
Without our ears. Thou art not what thou seem'st.
Why, Percy I kill'd myself, and saw thee dead!
This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back.
For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
                                       A retreat is sounded.
The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
Come, brother, let's to the highest of the field,
To see what friends are living, who are dead.
                      Exeunt [Prince Henry and Prince John].
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
The Noble Percy slain and all his men
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
And falling from a hill,he was so bruis'd
That the pursuers took him. At my tent
The Douglas is, and I beseech Your Grace
I may dispose of him.
Then brother John of Lancaster, to you
This honourable bounty shall belong.
Go to the Douglas and deliver him
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.
His valour shown upon our crests today
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds,
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
