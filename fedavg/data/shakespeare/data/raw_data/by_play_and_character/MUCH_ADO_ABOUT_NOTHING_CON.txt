What the goodyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure
sad?
You should hear reason.
If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against
your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where
it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest.
Can you make no use of your discontent?
To the death, my lord.
Here, man. I am at thy elbow.
I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy
tale.
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
I wonder at it.
Yes, it is apparel.
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
No; 'twas the vane on the house.
All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears out more
apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the
fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling
me of the fashion?
And thought they Margaret was Hero?
Masters, masters--
Masters--
us.
A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
                                                     Exeunt.
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
Off, coxcomb!
Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
