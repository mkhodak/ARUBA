My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,
With all these living in philosophy.
Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
How follows that?
In reason nothing.
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.          Exit
O most divine Kate!
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted.
As upright as the cedar.
As fair as day.
O that I had my wish!
I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood, and will rememb'red be.
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
[Reads]
    'On a day-alack the day!-
    Love, whose month is ever May,
    Spied a blossom passing fair
    Playing in the wanton air.
    Through the velvet leaves the wind,
    All unseen, can passage find;
    That the lover, sick to death,
    Wish'd himself the heaven's breath.
    "Air," quoth he "thy cheeks may blow;
    Air, would I might triumph so!
    But, alack, my hand is sworn
    Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
    Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
    Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.
    Do not call it sin in me
    That I am forsworn for thee;
    Thou for whom Jove would swear
    Juno but an Ethiope were;
    And deny himself for Jove,
    Turning mortal for thy love."'
This will I send; and something else more plain
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
O, would the King, Berowne and Longaville,
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
Would from my forehead wipe a perjur'd note;
For none offend where all alike do dote.
It is Berowne's writing, and here is his name.
                                   [Gathering up the pieces]
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
O vile! Then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
Some salve for perjury.
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
Fair lady-
Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
                                       [They converse apart]
Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
A Judas!
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
The more shame for you, Judas!
The head of a bodkin.
The carv'd-bone face on a flask.
Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
For the latter end of his name.
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
More calf, certain.
He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.
A gilt nutmeg.
No, cloven.
That mint.
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
[Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
Most rare Pompey!
Hector trembles.
Hector will challenge him.
Room for the incensed Worthies!
Most resolute Pompey!
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
But what to me, my love? but what to me?
A wife?
O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
The worthy knight of Troy.
