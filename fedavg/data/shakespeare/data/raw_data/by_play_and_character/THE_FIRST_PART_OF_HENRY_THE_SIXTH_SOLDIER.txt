I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;
For I have loaden me with many spoils,
Using no other weapon but his name.                     Exit
                         SCENE 2.
                  ORLEANS. Within the town
        Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a CAPTAIN,
                       and others
