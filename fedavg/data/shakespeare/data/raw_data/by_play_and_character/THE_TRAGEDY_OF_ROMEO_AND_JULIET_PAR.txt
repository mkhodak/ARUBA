Of honourable reckoning are you both,
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
Monday, my lord.
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
My father Capulet will have it so,
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
Come you to make confession to this father?
Do not deny to him that you love me.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
(O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
                                                Whistle Boy.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
   Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
                and a crow of iron.
This is that banish'd haughty Montague
That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died-
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
I do defy thy, conjuration
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
