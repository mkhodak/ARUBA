But what's the matter?
None but the King?
And why so?
You speak him far.
What's his name and birth?
I honour him
Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
Is she sole child to th' King?
How long is this ago?
That a king's children should be so convey'd,
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
That could not trace them!
I do well believe you.
