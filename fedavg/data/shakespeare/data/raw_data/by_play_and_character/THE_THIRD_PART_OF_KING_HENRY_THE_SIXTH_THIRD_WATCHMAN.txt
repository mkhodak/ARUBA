But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the King here resteth in his tent?
O, is it So? But why commands the King
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
While he himself keeps in the cold field?
Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
I like it better than dangerous honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
