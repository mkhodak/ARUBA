If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
We must return to th' court of guard. The night
Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
By th' second hour i' th' morn.
Enobarbus?
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.
The hand of death hath raught him.
[Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
Is fully out.
