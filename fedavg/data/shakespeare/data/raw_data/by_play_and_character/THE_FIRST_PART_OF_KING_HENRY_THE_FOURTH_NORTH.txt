My lord-
Yea, my good lord.
Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
As is delivered to your Majesty.
Either envy, therefore, or misprision
Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.
What, drunk with choler? Stay, and pause awhile.
Here comes your uncle.
                      Enter Worcester.
Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.
He was; I heard the proclamation.
And then it was when the unhappy King
(Whose wrongs in us God pardon!) did set forth
Upon his Irish expedition;
From whence he intercepted did return
To be depos'd, and shortly murdered.
He did; myself did hear it.
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
At Berkeley Castle.
Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.
Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.
