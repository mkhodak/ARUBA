Madam, the same-your servant.
Noble lady,
First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,
The King's request that I would visit you,
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
Sends you his princely commendations
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
Madam, in good health.
Most willing, madam.
By heaven, I will,
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
