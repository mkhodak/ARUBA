Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,
Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come.
                      [Exeunt Prince John and Westmoreland.]
But, soft! whom have we here?
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
This is the strangest tale that ever I beard.
I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,
Which I shall give away immediately.
