Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that
they speak i' the nose thus?
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
O, thereby hangs a tail.
Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But,
masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your
music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more
noise with it.
If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again;
but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly
care.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away.
Go, vanish into air, away!                      Exeunt Musicians.
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem
to notify unto her.
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
stabbing.
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own
throat.
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
and by them answer.
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
I will attempt the doing it.                                Exit.
