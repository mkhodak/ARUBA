Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
tell me.
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
                                           [CLARENCE sleeps]
              Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant
