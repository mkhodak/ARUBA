Stay. Whence are you?
From whence?
YOU may not pass; you must return. Our general
Will no more hear from thence.
Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name
Is not here passable.
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf
as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here;
no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely.
Therefore go back.
You are a Roman, are you?
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in
a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think
to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the
virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied
intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore
back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd;
our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.
Come, my captain knows you not.
My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I
let forth your half pint of blood. Back- that's the utmost of
your having. Back.
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back?
A noble fellow, I warrant him.
