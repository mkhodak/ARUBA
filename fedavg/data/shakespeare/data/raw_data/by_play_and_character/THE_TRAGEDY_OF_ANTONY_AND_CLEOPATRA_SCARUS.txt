Gods and goddesses,
All the whole synod of them!
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-
The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
Hoists sails and flies.
She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
What further comes.
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now 'tis made an H.
We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
Room for six scotches more.
                    Enter EROS
Let us score their backs
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
For both, my lord.
Swallows have built
In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
Of what he has and has not.
                        [Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight]
                  Re-enter ANTONY
