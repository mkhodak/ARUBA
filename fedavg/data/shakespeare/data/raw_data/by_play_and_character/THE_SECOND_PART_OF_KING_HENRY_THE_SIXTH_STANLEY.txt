So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace.
Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
There to be us'd according to your state.
Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey's lady;
According to that state you shall be us'd.
Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
And go we to attire you for our journey.
