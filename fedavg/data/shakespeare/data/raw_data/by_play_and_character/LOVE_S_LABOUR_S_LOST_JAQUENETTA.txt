Man!
That's hereby.
Lord, how wise you are!
With that face?
So I heard you say.
Fair weather after you!
God give you good morrow, Master Person.
Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter;
it was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I
beseech you read it.
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange
queen's lords.
Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
God bless the King!
I beseech your Grace, let this letter be read;
Our person misdoubts it: 'twas treason, he said.
Of Costard.
