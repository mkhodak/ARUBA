And you.
I have been sometimes there.
What's your will?
The King's not here.
Not indeed.
He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
Than is his use.
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
Whither I am going.
This I'll do for you.
I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
Gracious sovereign,
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
Here's a petition from a Florentine,
Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
To tender it herself. I undertook it,
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
Is here attending; her business looks in her
With an importing visage; and she told me
In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
Your Highness with herself.
