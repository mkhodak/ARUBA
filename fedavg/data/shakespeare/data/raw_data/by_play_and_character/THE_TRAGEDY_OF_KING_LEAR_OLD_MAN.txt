O my good lord,
 I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,
 These fourscore years.
You cannot see your way.
How now? Who's there?
'Tis poor mad Tom.
Fellow, where goest?
Madman and beggar too.
Ay, my lord.
Alack, sir, he is mad!
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
 Come on't what will.                                  Exit.
