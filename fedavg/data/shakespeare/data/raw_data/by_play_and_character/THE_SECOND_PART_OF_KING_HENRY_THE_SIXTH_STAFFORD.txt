Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;
Home to your cottages, forsake this groom;
The King is merciful if you revolt.
Villain, thy father was a plasterer;
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
Ay, sir.
And will you credit this base drudge's words
That speaks he knows not what?
O gross and miserable ignorance!
Herald, away; and throughout every town
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
That those which fly before the battle ends
May, even in their wives'and children's sight,
Be hang'd up for example at their doors.
And you that be the King's friends, follow me.
                       Exeunt the TWO STAFFORDS and soldiers
