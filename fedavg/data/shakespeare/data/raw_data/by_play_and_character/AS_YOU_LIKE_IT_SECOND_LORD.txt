We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
Upon the sobbing deer.
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.

Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
And she believes, wherever they are gone,
That youth is surely in their company.
