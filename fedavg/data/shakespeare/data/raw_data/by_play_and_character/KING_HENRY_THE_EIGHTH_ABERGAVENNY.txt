I cannot tell
What heaven hath given him-let some graver eye
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?
If not from hell, the devil is a niggard
Or has given all before, and he begins
A new hell in himself.
I do know
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
By this so sicken'd their estates that never
They shall abound as formerly.
Is it therefore
Th' ambassador is silenc'd?
A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd
At a superfluous rate!
As the Duke said,
The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure
By me obey'd.
