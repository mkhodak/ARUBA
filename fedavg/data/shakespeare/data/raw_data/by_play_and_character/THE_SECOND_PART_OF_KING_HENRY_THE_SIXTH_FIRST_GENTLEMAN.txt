What is my ransom, master, let me know?
I'll give it, sir: and therefore spare my life.
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
His body will I bear unto the King.
If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
So will the Queen, that living held him dear.
                                          Exit with the body
