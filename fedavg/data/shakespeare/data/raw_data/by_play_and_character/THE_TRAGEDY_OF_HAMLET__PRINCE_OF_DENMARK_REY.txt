I will, my lord.
My lord, I did intend it.
Ay, very well, my lord.
As gaming, my lord.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
But, my good lord-
Ay, my lord,
I would know that.
Very good, my lord.
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
gentleman.'
My lord, I have.
Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
I shall, my lord.
Well, my lord.
