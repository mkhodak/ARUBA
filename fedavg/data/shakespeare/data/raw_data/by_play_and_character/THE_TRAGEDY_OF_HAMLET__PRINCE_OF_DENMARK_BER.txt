Who's there.?
Long live the King!
He.
'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Have you had quiet guard?
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
                Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
Say-
What, is Horatio there ?
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
I have seen nothing.
Sit down awhile,
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we two nights have seen.
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one-
                    Enter Ghost.
In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
It would be spoke to.
See, it stalks away!
How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
I think it be no other but e'en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
That was and is the question of these wars.
'Tis here!
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
