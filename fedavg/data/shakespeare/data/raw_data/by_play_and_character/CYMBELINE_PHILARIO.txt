You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
is with that which makes him both without and within.
His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have
been often bound for no less than my life.
                   Enter POSTHUMUS
Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as
suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman,
whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is
I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his
own hearing.
Let us leave here, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let
it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.
I will have it no lay.
Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow 'em.
                                                      Exeunt
What means do you make to him?
Your very goodness and your company
O'erpays all I can do. By this your king
Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
Will do's commission throughly; and I think
He'll grant the tribute, send th' arrearages,
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief.
See! Iachimo!
Welcome, sir.
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there?
Have patience, sir,
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
It may be probable she lost it, or
Who knows if one her women, being corrupted
Hath stol'n it from her?
Sir, be patient;
This is not strong enough to be believ'd
Of one persuaded well of.
Quite besides
The government of patience! You have won.
Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself.
